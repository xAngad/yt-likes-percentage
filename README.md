# Show Likes and Dislikes as Percentages

This is a Google Chrome extension for [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), that displays viewer sentiment metrics (ie. likes and dislikes) as percentages rather than numbers. 

This was created anticipating YouTube's removal of the dislike count for videos, which can negatively impact viewer experience.
